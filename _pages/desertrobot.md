## Different soils are more or less erodible

Geologists commonly treat all soils of a certain size class as having the same erodibility to wind and mechanical. This approximation breaks down when the soils is moist, under compaction, or has formed a crust (2nd picture from right in image above). 

## Measuring real world erodibility is important but difficult

We would like to estimate variations in real world erodibility because it impacts our ability to predict how land will react to increasing desertification and how dust emmisions will effect the climate among other things. Historically, measuring erodibilty in the field has been a challenging task and has involved bulky equipment that is expensive and time consuming to deploy. In collaboration with Feifei Qian at the [Kod\*lab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/), my PhD advisor and I sought to come up with one solution to this by utilizing the recently developed RHEX semi-autonomous robotic platform for desert research. A video of this terrestrial robot in action can be seen below:

Our idea was to utilize the ground interaction forces generated by the robots legs to estimate how erodible a desert soil might be to wind erosion or mechanical disturbance. To do this we built a prototype redesigned leg for this platform. We tested this prototype in the field by mounting it on the existing platform (pictured below).

## Project outcome

We have written up the results of our work in a paper entitled: "Rapid in‚Äêsitu characterization of soil erodibility with a field deployable robot." This work was recently accepted by the Journal of Geophysical Research and can be found [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JF004887?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R).
