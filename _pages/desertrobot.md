We have written up the results of our work in a paper entitled: "Rapid in‚Äêsitu characterization of soil erodibility with a field deployable robot." This work was recently accepted by the Journal of Geophysical Research and can be found [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JF004887?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R).
