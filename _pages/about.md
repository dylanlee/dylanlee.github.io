![PRPic](/assets/images/PRDylanPicSmall.jpg){: .align-center} I'm an earth scientist broadly interested in natural processes. Specifically, I am highly motivated by the physics of the earth and ways in which humans can improve their understanding and relationship to our planet through insight into its underlying mechanics. I am very question motivated and am not afraid to delve deeply into new dialogues, skill-sets, and tools in order to approach a question from as many viewpoints as possible.
