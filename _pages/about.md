![PRPic](/assets/images/PRDylanPicSmall.jpg){: .align-left} I'm an earth scientist broadly interested in natural processes. Specifically, I am highly motivated by the physics of earth processes and ways in which man can improve his understanding and relationship to our planet through an improved understanding of it's underlying mechanics. I am very question motivated and am not afraid to delve deeply into new dialogues, skill-sets, and tools in order to approach a question from as many viewpoints as possible.
