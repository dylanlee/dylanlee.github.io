In this project we examine a rare example of a spatial “desertification gradient” at White Sands New Mexico, where active sand dunes slow down and are colonized by plants over a short distance. We show how plants stabilize dunes, by both slowing them down and changing their shape. 

This is important because sand dunes stabilized by vegetation can be suddenly re-activated due to climate or land-use change, with catastrophic consequences for surrounding communities. These findings are also relevant for rivers and coastal dune settings.

We have written up the results of our work in a paper entitled: "The imprint of vegetation on desert dune dynamics." A preprint can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/00g09ga749vyl7i/White_Sands.pdf?dl=0).
